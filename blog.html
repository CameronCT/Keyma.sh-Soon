                <div class="text-gray-500 text-sm">
                    I just want to say personally a huge thank you to everyone who has applied as a Tester as well as an increase in Moderators. We are currently at a total of <span class="font-semibold">6</span> testers!
                    If you currently have an application pending then please keep in mind that while we may not be looking for extra testers right away that doesn't mean your application won't get looked at in the near future
                    when we feel like we will need to expand the platform.

                <div class="text-gray-500 text-sm mt-4">
                    Over the past few weeks we have discussed a lot of potential that Keyma.sh can offer that other typing games / sites do not offer. Our goal is to incorporate all of the beauties from each of these games and
                    ma.sh them into one while retaining the enjoyment factor that these games already bring to a lot of typists.
                </div>

                <div class="font-semibold text-lg text-gray-300 mt-6">Competitive</div>
                <div class="text-gray-500 text-sm">
                    Something that has never been done in typing before, on a full release (but likely not open beta) we want to release a full competitive mode that could adjust the way tournaments are played today.
                    The idea behind this is that it could promote more potential <span class="font-semibold">team play</span> and allow typists to combine their skills against the best! Details on this will be released later.<br/><br/>
                    <span class="font-semibold">Oh, and yes</span> this means that there will be a form of ELO system in place along with ranked matchmaking.
                </div>

                <div class="font-semibold text-lg text-gray-300 mt-6">Mobile Gaming</div>
                <div class="text-gray-500 text-sm">
                    One of the biggest things we are trying to push for is a mobile UI responsive design that can allow typists to even help practice their texting skills.
                    Mobile gaming is still an insanely huge growing platform amongst the newer generation and we want to encourage mobile typists to play and improve.
                </div>

                <div class="font-semibold text-lg text-gray-300 mt-6">Texts</div>
                <div class="text-gray-500 text-sm">
                    We want to offer different forms of gameplay as a way of making the player not have the ability to be bored and be more encouraged to do different styles of typing such as:<br/><br/>
                    - Book, Movie, Music Texts<br/>
                    - Random Word Generator (Up to 500 words)<br/>
                    - Ma.sh Generator of Quotes (specific texts, arranged word order)
                </div>

                <div class="font-semibold text-lg text-gray-300 mt-6">Experience / Perks</div>
                <div class="text-gray-500 text-sm">
                    Part of our plan is to utilize an Experience / Level system. Where a player can gain Experience from any form of racing with the exception of practice.
                    All of this experience can later be redeemed for <span class="font-semibold">Playercards, Themes & more!</span>
